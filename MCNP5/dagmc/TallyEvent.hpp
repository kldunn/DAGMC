/**
 * \class TallyEvent
 * \brief Defines a single tally event
 *
 * TallyEvent is a class that represents a tally event that can be triggered
 * as part of a Monte Carlo particle transport simulation.  Both collision
 * and track-based events can be created.  Note that once an event type has
 * been set it cannot be changed.
 *
 * In addition to setting the required variables for each type of tally event,
 * there is also an optional method available to set the tally multiplier.
 * If the tally multiplier is not set, then it will default to 1.
 * 
 * This class is a Subject (Observable) class that keeps a list of Observers
 * to be Notified.  The Observers are added via the method attach(..)
