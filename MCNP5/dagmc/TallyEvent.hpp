/**
 * \class TallyEvent
 * \brief Defines a single tally event
 *
 * TallyEvent is a class that represents a tally event that can be triggered
 * as part of a Monte Carlo particle transport simulation.  Both collision
 * and track-based events can be created.  Note that once an event type has
 * been set it cannot be changed.
 *
 * In addition to setting the required variables for each type of tally event,
 * there is also an optional method available to set the tally multiplier.
 * If the tally multiplier is not set, then it will default to 1.
 *
 * TODO: This is a temporary class structure that will be changed once we
 * merge with the observer pattern implementation in meshtally_reftest branch.
 * Taking this first step will make it easier to merge with KDEMeshTally since
 * I am making some substantial changes to it as a part of the boundary
 * correction method.
