 * \class KDEMeshTally
 * \brief Represents a mesh tally based on a kernel density estimator approach
 *
 * KDEMeshTally is a Derived class that implements the MeshTally interface to
 * enable the use of the kernel density estimator as a mesh tally option in a
 * Monte Carlo particle transport simulation.  Three different types of KDE
 * mesh tallies can be created
 *
 *     1) KDE COLLISION mesh tally, based only on particle collisions
 *     2) KDE INTEGRAL_TRACK mesh tally, based on full particle tracks
 *     3) KDE SUB_TRACK mesh tally, based on approximated particle tracks
 *
 * The primary difference between these three options is what estimator is used
 * to compute the tally scores for the collisions or particle tracks that are
 * received from the Monte Carlo particle transport code.  Note that this cannot
 * be changed once a KDEMeshTally object has been created.
 *
 * For more information on using kernel density estimator methods for mesh tally
 * purposes, please refer to the following two references

 *        Carlo Tallies on Unstructured Meshes," Transactions of the American
 *        Nuclear Society, 107, pp. 490-493 (2012)

 * ==============
 * MeshTallyInput
 * ==============
 *
 * In addition to choosing the type of estimator, the user must also prepare a
 * MeshTallyInput object that will be used to set all of the other required and
 * optional input parameters.  This is a struct defined in MeshTally.hpp that
 * must include the tally ID number, the energy bin boundaries, whether or not
 * a total energy bin is required, the name of the mesh input file, and a
 * std::map with all other tally options as key-value pairs.  Tally options
 * that are currently available include the following
 *
 *     1) "out": defines the name of the KDE mesh tally output file
 *     2) "hx", "hy", "hz": sets the value of the bandwidth vector components
 *     3) "kernel": defines the kernel function to be used
 *     4) "seed": overrides random number seed for determining sub-track points
 *     5) "subtracks": sets number of sub-tracks to use
 *
 * The last two options are only valid for KDE sub-track mesh tallies.  Note
 * also that if an invalid "kernel" is requested, or this key is not included
 * in the MeshTallyInput options, then the default 2nd-order "epanechnikov"
 * kernel function is used.  Other options include "uniform", "biweight",
 * or "triweight".
 *
 * TODO need to add higher-order kernels/boundary kernel as available keys in
 * tally options as well
 *
 * ===============
 * Mesh Input File
 * ===============
 *
 * The mesh input file that is added to MeshTallyInput must be created in a file
 * format that is supported by the Mesh-Oriented Database (MOAB), which includes
 * both H5M and VTK options.  Source code and more information on MOAB can be
 * found at https://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/ITAPS/wiki/MOAB
 *
 * ============================
 * KDE Mesh Tally Functionality
 * ============================
 *
 * After a KDEMeshTally object has been created, there are a few simple steps
 * that are needed to ensure that the tally will work correctly.  The first step
 * is to use the compute_score() method for every tally event that is reported
 * by the Monte Carlo particle transport code being used.  These tally events
 * can be either collision or track-based, as the compute_score() method will
 * use the type of estimator that has been associated with the KDEMeshTally
 * object for computing the corresponding tally scores.  These scores are
 * accumulated in the MeshTally::temp_tally_data array.
 *
 * The second step is to use the end_history() method once all tally scores for
 * a single particle history has been completed.  This step takes the current
 * sum of scores that is in MeshTally::temp_tally_data and adds it to the
 * MeshTally::tally_data array.  It is also important for calculating the
 * relative standard error of the final tally results.
 *
 * The third and final step is to use the print() method to write all of the
 * tally results and their corresponding relative standard errors to the output
 * file.  If the "out" key is not included as a tally option, then the default
 * case is a H5M file format named meshtal<tally_id>.h5m.  To write to another
 * file format that is supported by MOAB, simply add the "out" key and use a
 * name with the desired extension.  For example, to write to a VTK file format,
 * add "out" = "file_name.vtk" to the MeshTallyInput options.
